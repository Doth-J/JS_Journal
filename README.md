# Dear JS Journal :blue_book:
- ## Entry 1 // *Hello_World.js* 
It is important to take notes of the trials and errors made through a learning journey and it is crucial to witness firsthand **what**,**where** and **when** something went accordingly and succeed or errored and failed. The JS documentation used is [MDN Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) while other resources found are documented and linked inside the individual repos.
>``Doth #`` I'm making this repository as a way to keep track of my progress in the concepts of web programming while learning about JS. It consists of personal collections from various concepts and implementations I did in Javascript. When I started learning JS, I remember being perplexed on the concept of a browser language being able to provide such dynamic capabilities to a hypertext file. Even more so, when I found out about NodeJS, where all these amazing capabilities could be utilized directly from a node without any browser environment. I started then by scouring through the Internet to seek answers like a spider on a giant web, crawling my way through the links, articles, documentations, repositories, papers... basically anything that I could index from this gargantuan digital weave of data.        
### Programming Basics
Programming languages provide the building blocks to create amazing application and services that can be accessed from the Internet. Each programming language has a specific syntax on how to define something and use it. From my experience in JS, the basics concepts one needs to understand to get a solid fountaition are the following:
- Variables
- Control Flows
- Functions
