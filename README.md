# Dear JS Journal :blue_book:
- ## Entry 1 // *Hello_World.js* 
It is important to take notes of the trials and errors made through a learning journey and it is crucial to witness firsthand **what**,**where** and **when** something went accordingly and succeed or errored and failed. The JS documentation used is [MDN Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) while other resources found are documented and linked inside the individual repos.
>``Doth #`` I'm making this repository as a way to keep track of my progress in the concepts of web programming while learning about JS. It consists of personal collections from various concepts and implementations I did in Javascript. When I started learning JS, I remember being perplexed on the concept of a browser language being able to provide such dynamic capabilities to a hypertext file. Even more so, when I found out about NodeJS, where all these amazing capabilities could be utilized directly from a node without any browser environment. I started then by scouring through the Internet to seek answers like a spider on a giant web, crawling my way through the links, articles, documentations, repositories, papers... basically anything that I could index from this gargantuan digital weave of data.        

### Programming Basics
Programming languages provide the building blocks to create awesome application and services that can be accessed from the Internet. Each programming language has a specific syntax on how to define **something** and use it. From my programming experience, the [basic concepts](./ProgrammingBasics/README.md) one needs to understand to get a solid fountation on JS programming are the following:
- [**Variables**](./ProgrammingBasicsJS/examples/variables/)
- **Arrays**
- **Objects**   
- **Functions**
- **Control Flows**

## Entry 2 // *Hello_Console.js* 
When you need to see firsthand that a language has indeed performed **this**  or **that** thing or any kind of execution and computation, it is necessary to learn how the language can show something back to you.
>``Doth #`` Personally, this was always the way I began when first learning a programming language. Once you have a solid understanding of the basics syntax and coding elements,how you can create an **object** with a **value** or some **operation** like a function, you then move on to understand how you can interact with the console, for example, tell it to do something and show you the result. This very simple method I'm taking about is ``console.log()`` for JS, which a method that shows you what the heck is going on under the hood when code is executing.
